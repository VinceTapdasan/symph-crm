/**
 * Centralized TanStack Query key factory.
 *
 * Rules:
 * - ALWAYS import from here — never hardcode string arrays in components.
 * - Key hierarchy: [entity] → [entity, id] → [entity, id, relation]
 * - Invalidating a parent key invalidates ALL child keys automatically.
 *   e.g. invalidate(queryKeys.companies.all) also invalidates .detail() and .deals()
